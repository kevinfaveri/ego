I'm currently developing backend services with NodeJS (mainly Express), frontend apps with Vue/React and mobile apps with React Native. Also, I've a lot of experience with Java, and more specifically, Spring Boot framework.

It's worth mentioning that because of some work done in DevOps space I've got a very good understanding of CI/CD tools, Docker and Kubernetes.
